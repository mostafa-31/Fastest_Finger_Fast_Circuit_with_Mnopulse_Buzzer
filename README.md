# Fastest Finger Fast Circuit with Monopulse Buzzer

This repository contains the design and implementation of the **Fastest Finger Fast Circuit** using a monopulse buzzer. The circuit is designed for quick user response detection and can be used in quiz games or similar applications.

## Features
- Detects the fastest response among multiple participants.
- Utilizes a monopulse buzzer for clear and instant feedback.
- Compact and efficient design.

## How it Works
- The circuit is designed to register the first response.
- Once a button is pressed, the corresponding light or buzzer indicates the winner.
